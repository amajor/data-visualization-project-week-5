# Data Visualization

## Project Week 5 & 6

Reviewing data about unemployment claims in 2019 and 2020.

See results from [the Jupyter Lab in pdf form](./docs/JupyterLab.pdf).

## Run

Use the command line or launch using your **Anaconda Navigator**.
```commandline
jupyter-lab
```

## Setup

The easiest setup may be to install [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/).
Once installed, open the application and then navigate to this repository.
Then open the `unemployment.ipynb` and run/edit in the browser.

_Anaconda seems to be the easiest way to get dependencies installed (they continue to fail for me with just a `pip install`)_
